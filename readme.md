# Algorithms

This repository contains a collection of algorithms implemented in Go.

## Binary Search

The binary search algorithm is implemented in the `binary_search` package. It performs a binary search on a sorted array to find a target element.

## Selection Sort

The selection sort algorithm is implemented in the `selection_sort`  package. It sorts an integer array in ascending order by repeatedly selecting the minimum element from the unsorted portion of the array and placing it in its correct position.

## Quick Sort

The quicksort algorithm is implemented in the `quick_sort` package. It efficiently sorts an integer array by dividing the input into smaller sub-arrays, sorting them recursively, and combining them to obtain the final sorted array.


## Breadth-First Search (BFS)

The Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm is implemented in the `breadth_first_search` package. This algorithm is used to traverse or search a graph or tree in a breadthward motion. It explores all the vertices or nodes of a given level before moving to the next level.
