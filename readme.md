# Algorithms

This repository contains a collection of algorithms implemented in Go.

## Binary Search

The binary search algorithm is implemented in the `binary_search` package. It performs a binary search on a sorted array to find a target element.

## Selection Sort

The selection sort algorithm is implemented in the `selection_sort`  package. It sorts an integer array in ascending order by repeatedly selecting the minimum element from the unsorted portion of the array and placing it in its correct position.

## Quick Sort

The quicksort algorithm is implemented in the `quick_sort` package. It efficiently sorts an integer array by dividing the input into smaller sub-arrays, sorting them recursively, and combining them to obtain the final sorted array.


## Merge Sort

The merge sort algorithm is implemented in the `merge_sort` package. It is a highly efficient sorting algorithm that follows the divide-and-conquer approach. It works by dividing the unsorted array into smaller subarrays, sorting them recursively, and then merging them back together to obtain the final sorted array. Merge sort guarantees a time complexity of O(n log n) and is known for its stability, preserving the relative order of elements with equal values. The algorithm's systematic merging of sorted subarrays makes it a reliable choice for sorting tasks that require stability and consistent performance.

## Breadth-First Search (BFS)

The Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm is implemented in the `breadth_first_search` package. This algorithm is used to traverse or search a graph or tree in a breadthward motion. It explores all the vertices or nodes of a given level before moving to the next level.
