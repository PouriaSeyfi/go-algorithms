# Algorithms

This repository contains a collection of algorithms implemented in Go.

## Binary Search

The binary search algorithm is implemented in the `binary_search` package. It performs a binary search on a sorted array to find a target element.

## Selection Sort

The selection sort algorithm is implemented in the `selection_sort`  package. It sorts an integer array in ascending order by repeatedly selecting the minimum element from the unsorted portion of the array and placing it in its correct position.
